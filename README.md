# SRC-Statistics
This script fetches data from SRC's free api (as of time of writting). With the data fetched, it will calculate some statistics and display them on the terminal or on a qt application.

The entire script is written by Niamek.

# Installation required before using the script
Before using the script, you need to have python 3.10 installed on the computer. 
- WINDOWS : https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows
- MAC : https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/

>I'm not 100% sure if any Python 3 version will work since the interpreter I have is 3.10. If you have any python 3 versions, you can try it first before updating.

After installing python 3, you'll need to install some modules on the computer.
Here are the three modules the script needs in order to work correctly:
-pyqt5
-matplotlib
-requests

Here is the command you need to type in the terminal to install all of them at once:
`pip install requests pyqt5 matplotlib`
If you ar eon mac, you'll need to type this:
`pip3 install requests pyqt5 matplotlib`
